    <h1>Unpaid Salary and Cheating to Customers</h1>
    <h1>Meer Subur Ali</h1>
    <p>
        I am writing this to talk about my personal experience and my colleagues experience regarding unpaid salary. 
        I worked for a Spaceman design and despite completing my responsibilities,
        I have not yet received the payment that I believe I am owed.
        This person just tend to cheat each and everyone and he thinks he can be happy with other people sweat and blood.
    </p>

    <div class="notice">
        <strong>My Statement:</strong><br>
        I feel disappointed and let down by the situation. I believe it is unfair and unprofessional to withhold someone's salary after they have fulfilled their duties and each time lieng about I don't have any money my money is stuck in bank and he gives such non sense reasons. I have all the call recordings with him where he alegedly saying I will pay you next month every month he has said same thing. 
    </div>

    <p>
        Since I have not been paid I'm removing the code from my personal repository. Even though I had let this repository to stay in the repository for 2 years for free I can't let be active anymore. This person has no self respect and don't know to stick to his words, when ever he opens his mouth he just spit lies.
    </p>

    <h2>I Am suggesting:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Full payment of my pending salary</li>
        <li>Clear communication and accountability</li>
        <li>Professional closure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I hope this matter gets resolved soon. Payment for completed work is not a favor — it's a responsibility. Karma is the one thing which will bounce back. Karma has no menu. You get served what you deserve. <strong>I will pray for your downfall and illness every day for the mental stress you have caused me.</strong>
